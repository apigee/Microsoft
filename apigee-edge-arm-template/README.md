# apigee-edge-arm-template
This project allows you to install edge in Azure using Azure resource manager template. 

## Prerequisite

### azure
- Create an account with azure portal. You may get free quota to run aio. To run multi node, you need additional CPU quota and have to request azure support team to upgrade quota. 

## Apigee Private Cloud
Please go through http://docs.apigee.com/private-cloud/content/version-41709 to know more about Apigee Edge Private Cloud.

## Apigee Deployment on Azure

 - At this point of time, supported topologies are 1,5 and 9. 
 - Additionally it also create Developer portal in a separate node for all supported toplogies. So for example if you choose to deploy 5 node topology, it will deploy developer portal on 6th node.
 
 - Supported Deployment Topologies

Edge Topology- 1 node

## Getting Started
- Create a ssh key pair with the user apigeetrial. Replace -C parameter if your machine's admin user is different than apigeetrial.
    ```
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "apigeetrial" -N "" -f apigeetrial.key
    ```
    This generates a key pair file apigeetrial.key and apigeetrial.key.pub
    - so the public key file should like  
          ```
            sh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAACAQDMQYOx.....2OA0jecyUx+3+Okp2dzhw== apigeetrial
          ```
    - In case you are using the command line to deploy, use following command to get the key in one line.
    ```
    cat apigeetrial.key | tr '\n' ' '
    ```
    You don't have to do this if you are deploying it in portal

- Deploy to Azure using link below
<a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fapigee%2Fmicrosoft%2F19xue%2Fapigee-edge-arm-template%2Fazuredeploy.json" target="_blank">
    <img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/>
</a>

- Deploy using command line
  
  - Make appropriate changes in azuredeploy.parameters.json
  - Deploy using deploy.sh command

  ```
     ./deploy.sh <<RESOURCE NAME>>
     for ex:
     ./deploy.sh apigee
  ```

   - This template allows you to create a Apigee Instance in Azure.Once the deployment is successful, you can access Apigee Edge. You need to get the public IP/DNS of Managment server and Devportal machine.
  ```
     Edge UI  :  http://<FQDN of Mgmt Server Node>:9000/
     Edge UE  :  http://<FQDN of UE Node>:3001/
     Magemement Server : http://<FQDN name or public IP>:8080/
     Developer Portal :  http://<FQDN name or public IP>:8079/
   ```

## Troubleshootig

It uses ansible based scripts for multi node installation and there can be cases where the edge doesnt get installed even after 30 minutes. It may require additional diaganosis on what may have gone wrong in installation.

- Logging on to box

    For password authenticationType
    ssh apigeetrial:<password>@<FQDN of MGMT>
```
